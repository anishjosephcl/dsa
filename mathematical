https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/description/

Solve the problem using mod and div
Having 5 in the factorial will contribute to trailing 0
For numbers of 25 do a loop to find the count of 5 
Factorial of n/5  till 0
In each iteration, we divide n by 5 and add the result to count. This counts how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., contribute to the trailing zeros.
The multiple of 5 will contribute a 0
